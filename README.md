## Problem Statement

This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for comprehending the current status and scenarios of population increase in various countries. It provides a visual representation of how population growth has unfolded, highlighting the contrasting trends between lower-income countries experiencing significant increases and developed countries where population growth is more controlled. The insights gleaned from this visualization can be further analyzed to delve into diverse issues related to population dynamics and formulate informed perspectives on associated challenges and opportunities.


### Steps followed

- Step 2: Load the data into Power BI Desktop; the dataset is in .xls format.
- Step 3: Transform the data using Power Query to modify the header. Then, close and save the data.
- Step 4: In the model view, you can observe an automatic connection in the fields.
- Step 5: Open the dashboard and create the required fields (Multi-row card, Slicer, Map, Clustered column chart) for further analysis
